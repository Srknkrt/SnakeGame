# SnakeGame

Details of the Project: When we enter the game, there are 4 different buttons. “SinglePlayerButton”, “MultiPlayerButton”, “HowToPlayButton”, “ExitButton” respectively. When we press the close button, the game closes. When we press the How to play button, the panel opens on the screen. In this panel, there is a return button at the top left and the basic information of the game in the panel.

When we press the single play button, we switch to the level screen. There are 10 different maps in the game. When we first start the game, we can play the level 1 map, if we manage to get 1 star from this level, we can move to the next level.

When we switch to the game screen, we start the game with two parts, the snake's head and tail. When the game starts, the snake moves in a random position and in a random direction. As you take the apples, the body parts of the snake increase. A chest is created every 20 seconds in the game, if we do not get the chest, the chest leaves the game after 10 seconds. When we get the chest, we add an extra feature to the snake for 7 seconds.

These features are; extra points (each apple gives 2x more points for 7 seconds), speed boost (snake 2x speed for 7 seconds), speed decrease (snake 2x speed for 7 seconds), cloudy weather (which occurs in random locations from the left side of the screen) cloud wave moves to the right side of the screen), confusion (the arrow keys on the screen, where we press the snake for 7 seconds to move, work in reverse. For example, when we press up, the snake moves down), invisibility (body parts except the snake's head and tail for 7 seconds) it becomes invisible if we eat apples like this, newly formed body parts are visibly formed).

Every time we exceed 1000 points in the game, there is a slight increase in speed, this increase stops after 5000 points and we reach the maximum speed.

When we press the stop game button in the upper right corner of the game screen, we can change the color of the snake, we can see the highest score we have made so far, and there is a horizontal moving button where we can increase or decrease the sounds of the game.

When we press the restart game button in the upper right corner of the game screen, the game scene works again and the game restarts. If we want to switch from the game scene to the level scene, we can do this by pressing the button marked home.

Our playing time and instant score are written in the upper left corner of the game screen.

At the top of the game screen, there are informative articles about what to do while playing the game.

When we press the multiplayer button, we switch to the lobby screen. On the lobby screen, there is a section where we need to write the name of the room we will enter or set up and write our own nickname. When we enter the information and press the button, it throws us to the multiplayer screen (I couldn't finish the entire multiplayer screen at the moment, only the heads of the snakes of the people who are connected are formed side by side and these heads move).
